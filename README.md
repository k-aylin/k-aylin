My public code is provided as-is without warranty. **It is intended for personal use only.** Executables are not provided — please build from source and review third-party licenses, as I do not vet them for this work.

* If you fork or build on my code, please credit me in your repos and finished products by linking to my profile or the original repository. The repositories I own consist solely of my own work, unless otherwise cited.
* If you're here in connection with a job application of mine, I'm happy to verify ownership of this account. Please reach out via the contact details in my application, and I'll create a secret Gist for confirmation.

I like to experiment with applications for desktop, web, and mobile platforms. Usually they are simple little quirky ideas that I build for practice and exploration. Check out PROJECTS.md for a categorized list.

I have been a professional software engineer since 2018. For personal projects, I use VS Code with GitHub Copilot.

Generative AI is a tool I accept for practical uses, for use as a tool not to replace jobs, such as for coding hints that increase productivity. I do not endorse AI-generated art in any setting, but especially in commercial settings or personal collections. I believe human creativity is irreplacable and I firmly support artists' livelihoods.
